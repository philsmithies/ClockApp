- Clock App built to explore Tailwind CSS and build something as a single page app that includes animations and API calls from various sites.

## Technologies Used

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TailWindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

## APIs Used

- World Time API to set the time based on the visitor's IP address. I additionally used this to set extra data under the 'MORE' toggle on the app.

- Programming Quotes API.
